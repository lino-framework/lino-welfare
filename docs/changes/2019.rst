==========

- Fixed #2853 Missing dependency in 'six' in welfare. The
  :xfile:`setup_info.py` may of course not import any module which is installed
  only during :xfile:`setup.py`.

- For Chatelet, #2851, I removed study_type from column_names of ContractsByClient, removed job_search from the main of
  pcsw.ClientDetail, I moved 'is_seeking unemployed_since seeking_since' from history_left to history_right of the main
  of pcsw.ClientDetail.
