2019-03-26 (v19.3.0)
====================

Moved :ref:`welfare` out of :ref:`book`.
Created a new repository :ref:`weleup`
and moved :file:`man/welfare_de` to :file:`weleup/dedocs`.
The welfare repo is now a library repo, similar to xl.
It contains demo projects, specs and api for both weleup
and welcht (it makes no sense to explain welfare without also explaining weleup
and welcht, and it makes no sense to write technical docs about weleup without
also explaining general welfare plugins).
The doctrees of welcht or weleup just contain a short description, installation
instructions and links to the real docs.

Fixed a bug (:ticket:`2917`) in
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.households.RefundsByPerson`.
This table considered children as adult only one year after the age
specified in :attr:`lino_xl.lib.households.Plugin.adult_age`.
Added a test case to cover this: :ref:`welfare.specs.households.20190326`.

Released version 19.3.0

==========

- French translation of "Excluded from" is now  "Du" (no longer "Exclus depuis")

2019-02-28
==========

Moved the chatelet part from the :mod:`lino_welfare` package into a new package
:mod:`lino_welcht`.  User code on production sites must replace
``lino_welfare.chatelet`` by ``lino_welcht``.
We plan to do the same operation for weleup soon.

Released version 19.2.0

- (:ticket:`2851`) Remove the filter added 2019-02-27 on pcsw.PersonGroup so the choicelists show
  only the activated groups. This filter was asked by Chatelet.


2019-02-27
==========

- (:ticket:`2853`) Missing dependency in 'six' in welfare. The
  :xfile:`setup_info.py` may of course not import any module which is installed
  only during :xfile:`setup.py`.

- (:ticket:`2851`) Added a filter on pcsw.PersonGroup so the choicelists show
  only the activated groups
