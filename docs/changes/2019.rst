==========

Moved the chatelet part from the :mod:`lino_welfare` package into a new package
:mod:`lino_welcht`.  User code on production sites must replace
``lino_welfare.chatelet`` by ``lino_welcht``.
We plan to do the same operation for weleup soon.

Released version 19.2.0

==========

- (:ticket:`2853`) Missing dependency in 'six' in welfare. The
  :xfile:`setup_info.py` may of course not import any module which is installed
  only during :xfile:`setup.py`.

- (:ticket:`2851`) Added a filter on pcsw.PersonGroup so the choicelists show
  only the activated groups
